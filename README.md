Java based two player vacuum game.

Similar to pacman, two players must collect dustballs and once all the dustballs in the map are collected, the player with the higher scores wins.

Vacuums get full and must be emptied in a dumpster.

Different types of dust, dustballs move randomly and drop dust. Dust stays in place on the map.
