A pacman like game designed in Java. 
There are two different players in the game. The goal of the game is to be the player with the higher score in the end. The player is 
represented as a Vacuum. Each player must collect dust and dustballs to gain points, and empty their vacuum inside a dumpster once it
gets full by going over the dumpster. Once a player collects a dust/dustball it will dissapear from the map. Dusts are stationary and 
dustballs can move. For every move a player makes, the dustball moves in an arbitrary direction. A dustball will always leave dust behind
everytime it moves. The game ends when all dust/dustballs are collected.
